My name is Shannon Holgate, I'm a Financial Engineering student from Northern Ireland. Currently I'm on my work placement at Kainos Software Ltd in Belfast where I am employed as a Software Engineer. My role at Kainos mostly involves writing client side code with a few exceptions where I do some server side stuff like writing SQL procedures and mapping the results set from them. I also get the opportunity to get involved in some R&D projects where I can learn some new technologies such as Ruby, Azure and MongoDB then apply what I've learn't.

Aside from my Kainos placement I like to keep busy with any other opportunities I can get my hands on. Up until now I've kept busy creating a couple of iOS apps which you can read about in my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>. I'm also keen to get involved competitions and any further development I can get my hands on.

In 2011 I got a chance to be involved in <a href="http://appcamp.co.uk/">Kainos App Camp</a> where I got my eyes opened to the world of IT and created my first iOS app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/no.-brainer/id456877051?mt=8">No.Brainer</a>. App Camp is where I received most of my knowledge in Objective-C, it's also where I got the motivation to push into IT and all the possibilites there is within the industry.
