My name is Shannon Holgate, I'm a Financial Engineering student from Northern Ireland. Currently I'm on my work placement at Kainos Software Ltd in Belfast where I am employed as a Software Engineer. My role at Kainos mostly involves writing client side code with a few exceptions where I do some server side stuff like writing SQL procedures and mapping the results set from them. I also get the opportunity to get involved in some R&D projects where I can learn some new technologies such as Ruby, Azure and MongoDB then apply what I've learn't.

Aside from my Kainos placement I like to keep busy with any other opportunities I can get my hands on. Up until now I've kept busy creating a couple of iOS apps which you can read about in my [Portfolio]. I'm also keen to get involved competitions and any further development I can get my hands on.

### Kainos App Camp

In 2011 I got a chance to be involved in [Kainos App Camp] where I got my eyes opened to the world of IT and created my first iOS app [No.Brainer]. App Camp is where I received most of my knowledge in Objective-C, it's also where I got the motivation to push into IT and all the possibilites there is within the industry.

### Imagine Cup

Back at university, I got involved with an [Imagine Cup] team. I mentored team SODDA to produce a drink driving simulator using Microsoft's Kinect with C#. The team were very successful placing 3rd in the Irish Imagine Cup finals 2012 - credit to the guys presenting in Dublin on the day!

### Elswhere...
More recently I've been involved in teaching secondary school students how to build simple Android apps using Google's App Inventor software. This was a fun and very rewarding challenge as the couple of teams I taught grew more proficient each day and eventually presented their apps to the judges. It was inspirational to see what junior students could do in such a short space of time.

In the future I may end up following my degree and move into the financial side of Computer Scicence by building something new and more efficient for the Stock Markets of the world. Although, for now, I will persue my creativity by creating random, useful applications to solve some of the simpler problems of everyday life.
